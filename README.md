# DynamicsofGamesProject
## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
1. To study the structure and equilibrium properties of **Discrete Colonel Blotto games**.
2. To review **Hart’s General Lotto relaxation**, solve the continuous and discrete cases, and understand how optimal marginal strategies arise.
3. To implement **regret minimisation algorithms** (Regret Matching / CFR) in the finite Blotto game \( \mathcal{B}(5,5;3) \).
4. To empirically verify convergence properties:
   - vanishing external regret,
   - convergence of the time-averaged strategy,
   - decay of exploitability,
   - and alignment with Hart’s feasible equilibrium.
5. To investigate practical algorithmic refinements, including:
   - epsilon error modelling (randomised play),
   - thresholding low-probability actions,
   - resetting strategy sums,
   and their impact on convergence rates.
